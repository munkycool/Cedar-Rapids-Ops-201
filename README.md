# Welcome to the notes 

## Hello and welcome to some finely crafted notes about  what I've been reading for this class, hosted here on one of the ugliest websites ever. 

# What's the role of the help desk?

## The interesting stuff

- The help desk is the "face" of the IT staff that interfaces directly with the outside world
- They are the first line of support for "the other side"

### HARD skills V. *Soft* skills

- Hard skills are the technical knowledge and other skills 
- Soft skills are more of the people skills like communication and writing 
- For a help desk position both are important to master 

### CT  (*Critical Thinking*)

- Actively thinking 
- Trying new things
- Asking questions

# Getting started with GitHub and VSCode. Also the orgins of BASH for whatever reason. And what a shell even is.

## VSCode 

### The Microsoft marketing jargon

- *vs code is an amazing lightweight code editor that runs on Windows macOS and Linux, with a rich ecosystem for other languages.*

## GitHub

- GitHub is a way to distribute code using Git 
- You can make a repository that stores all of the code for a project
- It's used by many open source projects as a way to distribute code 

## The origins of BASH

- It was created by Brian Fox as a FOSS shell and was an early proponent of the free software movement 
- As UNIX gave way to Linux (or GNU plus Linux I guess), the OS that drives much of the modern internet, BASH was installed on tens of thousands of computers
- Shellshock was a bug in BASH that no one saw coming. It's since been patched (I think)


# Making a system restore point in Windows 10

- system restore points are used to restore Windows to a previos state
- It will not affect any non-system files. So all of your cat pictures are going to be safe, but the TOR browser that you use all of the time isn't going to be safe if the resotore point is before you installed it 
- They can also be created automatically by Windows, not just manually
