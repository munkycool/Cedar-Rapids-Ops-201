# Making a system restore point in Windows 10

- system restore points are used to restore Windows to a previos state
- It will not affect any non-system files. So all of your cat pictures are going to be safe, but the TOR browser that you use all of the time isn't going to be safe if the resotore point is before you installed it 
- They can also be created automatically by Windows, not just manually
