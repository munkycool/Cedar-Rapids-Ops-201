## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/munkycool/Cedar-Rapids-Ops-201/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/munkycool/Cedar-Rapids-Ops-201/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

#Making a system restore point in Windows 10

- system restore points are used to restore Windows to a previos state
- It will not affect any non-system files. So all of your cat pictures are going to be safe, but the TOR browser that you use all of the time isn't going to be safe if the resotore point is before you installed it 
- They can also be created automatically by Windows, not just manually
