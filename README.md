# Welcome to the notes 

## Hello and welcome to some finely crafted notes about  what I've been reading for this class, hosted here on one of the ugliest websites ever that's lookin' like it was pulled straight from 2077... minus a few hundred years. 

# How to remove malware from a computer

- Boot the computer into safe mode
- Download a malware scanner like MalwareBytes 
- Run a malware scan with the software
- Run a Windows Defender full scan 
- If all else fails backup your personal file, and reset the PC 
- If your cool install Linux instead of Windows 

# How to get started with veeam

---

## The intro

- You can back up stuff using veeam
  
- You can back up running VMs
  
- veeam has native tape support
  
- You can use hardware accelerated compresion
  
- It has good integration with Hyper-V adn VMWare enviroments
  

---

*I know how much this sounds like an ad, and tbf the info did come from veeam's website, but I have never used veeam myself. Although it doesn't sound too bad, and i don't know of any FOSS solutions that quite compare to veeam.*


# You want to write an SOP?

### *the first step is figuring out what SOP stands for*

---

- SOP stands for Standard operating procedure
  
- It's scecific to "your" company
  
  - (I put your in quotes becasue it's not really yours is it? The only reason I put it here is because it was the best way to get the message accross, but on the whole I don't get why you would ever personally assosiate yourself with a company. It's like it's your friend or something, when it's really not
    
- SOP answers the what when and why
  
- They are the primary way to impliment and enforce policy
  
- They should be simple, portable, tell a story, be consistant, and it's all about the audence


# Windows Regestry ~~de~~mystified

Disclaimer: NOT RESONSIBLE FOR ANY "BROKEN" COMPUTERS. FOLLOW THIS ADVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THIS IS MEANT TO BE SOMEWHAT SATIRICAL.

---

## What is it?

It kinda tells things how to work anmd what to do

- Microsoft introduced the registry all the way back with Windows 3.1, and, along with other things, has stayed in Windows until the present day
  
  - in that era it was only used by certian programs, whereas nowadays it's used by basically every program on Windows
    

## Why should you care?

- You can change settings not normally made available by Windows
  
- It isn't dangerous as long as you know what your doing
  
  - And that's why you should listen to this random website when I reccomend that you just delete the Windows regestry to make the computer run faster, also delete the system32 folder for a pretty good speed boost. See, Microsoft is in the pockets of hardware manufacurers who want Microsoft to purposly slow down Windows to force you to buy new hardware. Break free of their evil clutches! For an instant speed boost you can unlock the secret speed mode on your CPU by pressing alt+F4
    
- To edit (or delete) the registy just open up the gui registry editor from the Windows start bar, just search regedit.exe
  
- To change a value just double click on any random thing and just start typing
  

## What can you do with it

- You can break Windows and stop it from booting, giving you the perfect exuse to install Kali on it
  
- You can change the manufacturing name of the PC
  
  - Watch out HP, Dell and Apple! My new PC company, DodgePC, is coming for you
    
- You can stop other users from shutting down your PC
  
- You can make Windows show a message every time that someone logs into your computer


# All about PowerShell

## Should you learn powershell

- Powershell is the command line interface that Microsoft created built on the .NET framework is meant to be kinda an upgrade to the cmd
  
- The main difference between bash and powershell is that bash using strings while powershell uses objects
  
- Powershell is cross platform
  

## Hackers are using powershell according to the immortal company, IBM

- A lot of hackers just used powershell scripts to carry out their deeds
  
- By using powershell scripting you can load things directly into memory
  
- The majority of scams are still phishing however


# What's the Microsoft Security Centre

## *Friend or foe?*

The Microsoft Security Centre is the hub for where all of Microsoft's security related stuff is for Microshaft Winblows, one might even call a *centre of Microsoft security*

### The basics

---

There are several different panels when one goes to the Security Centre website

---

#### Virus and threat protection

- This is where the virus and threat protection related stuff is
  
- You can run a scan of the system
  
- You can configure virus protection settings
  

---

#### Performence and Health

- This is where you can check up on the system
  

---

##

#### Firewall and network protection

- this is where you can configure the firewall, or configure advanced options by opening up a panel that looks like it hasn't changed since XP
  

---

#### App and browser control

- you can adjust smart screen settings for various apps and browsers
  

---

#### Family options

- This is where you can help protect your kids
  

## Other

- Microsoft's built in Defender is just fine, and you really don't need another third party antivirus. If you want a reason just search `avast privacy issues` and explore the results.
  
- If you set up family options then your kids will inevitably find a way to bypass it. I never had any family safety thingy keeping me safe on the internet and I turned out fine... I think.


# How to toubleshoot troubleshooting     

## *a step by step guide* (not really, but hey, it sounded good)

- If posible you want to duplicate the problem
  
  - So if they get error code ID10T then you want to get error code ID10T not SM4R7 or something like that
    
- Problems often come with multiple symptoms, it's never just one thing
  
- Since the end user is probably familiar with the system and what goes on with it make sure to hound them with questions
  
  - Good examples are
    
    - SSN
      
    - DOB
      
    - Street they grew up on
      
    - All thier passwords
      
    - Ect.
      
- If multiple things are happening simotaniusly then break it up into smaller tasks
  
- You need to consider every posible senario, even ones that don't seem that likely
  
- Once you identify the problem it's time to roll out the tanks, fire up Parrot, and attack head on
  
  - If one solution doesn't work make sure that you have a backup solution
    
- Once you apply a fix you still have to make sure that it works.
  
  - A backdoor is just as good as a wall if it's jamed shut
    
- Once you've made sure that you have access... or fixed the problem... make sure that you can still have access... I mean that the problem doesn't happen in the future


# What's the role of the help desk?

## The interesting stuff

- The help desk is the "face" of the IT staff that interfaces directly with the outside world
- They are the first line of support for "the other side"

### HARD skills V. *Soft* skills

- Hard skills are the technical knowledge and other skills 
- Soft skills are more of the people skills like communication and writing 
- For a help desk position both are important to master 

### CT  (*Critical Thinking*)

- Actively thinking 
- Trying new things
- Asking questions

# Getting started with GitHub and VSCode. Also the orgins of BASH for whatever reason. And what a shell even is.

## VSCode 

### The Microsoft marketing jargon

- *vs code is an amazing lightweight code editor that runs on Windows macOS and Linux, with a rich ecosystem for other languages.*

## GitHub

- GitHub is a way to distribute code using Git 
- You can make a repository that stores all of the code for a project
- It's used by many open source projects as a way to distribute code 

## The origins of BASH

- It was created by Brian Fox as a FOSS shell and was an early proponent of the free software movement 
- As UNIX gave way to Linux (or GNU plus Linux I guess), the OS that drives much of the modern internet, BASH was installed on tens of thousands of computers
- Shellshock was a bug in BASH that no one saw coming. It's since been patched (I think)


# Making a system restore point in Windows 10

- system restore points are used to restore Windows to a previos state
- It will not affect any non-system files. So all of your cat pictures are going to be safe, but the TOR browser that you use all of the time isn't going to be safe if the resotore point is before you installed it 
- They can also be created automatically by Windows, not just manually
