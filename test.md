# Getting started with GitHub and VSCode. Also the orgins of BASH for whatever reason. And what a shell even is.

## VSCode 

### The Microsoft marketing jargon

- *vs code is an amazing lightweight code editor that runs on Windows macOS and Linux, with a rich ecosystem for other languages.*

## GitHub

- GitHub is a way to distribute code using Git 
- You can make a repository that stores all of the code for a project
- It's used by many open source projects as a way to distribute code 

## The origins of BASH

- It was created by Brian Fox as a FOSS shell and was an early proponent of the free software movement 
- As UNIX gave way to Linux (or GNU plus Linux I guess), the OS that drives much of the modern internet, BASH was installed on tens of thousands of computers
- Shellshock was a bug in BASH that no one saw coming. It's since been patched (I think)
